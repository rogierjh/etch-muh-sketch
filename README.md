# etch-a-sketch
the assignment here is to make an etch-a-sketch using html, css, javascript
and jquery. for extra credit there's other stuff to do, but to be perfectly
honest i've spent so much time on this part of the course regurgitating all
this stuff already, i think i'll just leave it at the basic etch-a-sketch.
the extras would be:
• a version where each mouseenter event adds 10% black to the color, which
i'd probably do by adding 25 to each of the rgb(000,000,000) values;
• and a version that generates random colors for each new mouseenter event.
